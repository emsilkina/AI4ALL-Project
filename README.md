# AI-Driven Stock Investment Recommendation System
As part of the AI4ALL Ignite Fellowship, this project explores how supervised machine learning can predict short-term stock actions (Buy, Hold, or Sell) using historical stock price patterns and macroeconomic data. We focused on tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM, analyzing daily open and close prices in tandem with indicators like interest rates, inflation, and unemployment.

## Research Question
Can machine learning models accurately predict daily stock actions (Buy, Hold, Sell) for major tech companies based on historical price trends and macroeconomic indicators?

## Methods

- Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- Feature Engineering (Lagged prices, Moving averages, Rolling correlations)
- Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- Correlation Analysis between stock performance and economic trends

## Datasets
Located in the `/AI4ALL Project Datasets` directory, our data sources include:

- Historical stock prices (AAPL, MSFT, INTC, IBM)
- U.S. economic indicators (CPI, GDP, Unemployment, Federal Funds Rate)
- Global inflation rates by country

## Key Features

- Daily prediction of Buy/Hold/Sell actions
- Rolling and lagged correlation visualizations between stock and macro trends
- Feature normalization and merged datasets ready for modeling
- Model performance metrics to evaluate predictive accuracy

## Potential Applications

- Real-time stock recommendation tools
- Educational dashboards for finance learners
- Market insight visualizations for beginner investors
