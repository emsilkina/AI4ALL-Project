# AI-Driven Stock Investment Recommendation System

This project uses supervised machine learning to analyze historical stock prices and macroeconomic indicators in order to predict investment risk and return. By leveraging financial data from companies like Apple and Microsoft alongside economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, GDP growth, and unemployment, the model provides actionable recommendations: Invest, Hold, or Sell.

## Research Question
Can machine learning models accurately predict daily investment risk and return for major U.S. companies and provide reliable, real-time recommendations based on historical financial and macroeconomic trends?

## Methods
Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)
Feature Engineering (Lagging, Normalization, Rolling Correlation)
Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
Correlation Heatmaps & Time-Series Analysis
